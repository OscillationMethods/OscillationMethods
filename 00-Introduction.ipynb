    "This project is an overview of _methodological considerations_ for measuring and investigating neural oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is broadly a review of methodological topics, and largely focuses on relationships between data properties and methods assumptions, organized into seven key topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each topic includes a description of the issue, an exemplary demonstration, and notes on how to avoid the issue. Each topic was chosen to reflect a general considerations that is broadly relevant to at least many investigations of neural oscillations. Here we aim to collect together discussion of these considerations, though many of these topics have been been discussed in the literature before, and we also link out to other work that has highlighted, demonstrated, and discussed the topic at hand.

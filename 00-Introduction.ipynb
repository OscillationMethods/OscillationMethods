    "\n",
    "This project is an overview of _methodological considerations_ for measuring and investigating neural oscillations.\n",

    "In practice, this project is a review of methodological topics, with a focus on evaluating relationships between data properties and methods assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is organized into seven key topics. Each topic includes a description of the issue, example demonstrations, and notes on how to avoid the issue. Each topic was chosen to reflect a general consideration that is broadly relevant investigating neural oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overvall, this project aims to give an overview of and collect together discussion of these considerations. Many of these topics have been been discussed in the literature before, and links to other work that has highlighted, demonstrated, and discussed the topic at hand is also included."

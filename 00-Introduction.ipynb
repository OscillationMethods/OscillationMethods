    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an overview of a series of _methodological considerations_ for measuring and investigating neural oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is broadly a type of methods review, highlighting what we consider to be important considerations. Each topic also includes a description of the issue, an exemplary demonstration, and notes on how to avoid the issue. Each topic is chosen as it reflects a general consideration that relates fairly broadly to analyses of neural oscillations. The topics are not claimed to be novel observations, and we also link out to other work that has highlighted, demonstrated, and discussed the topic at hand. "
